        <h1>Chicken Empanadas</h1>

        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            It's always a great feeling when a recipe comes out well, but there's a little extra satisfaction 
           involved when it's something that's usually fried, and we've been able to successfully pull it off 
           in the oven. These chicken empanadas were a perfect example. Despite not firing up the deep fryer, 
           they were crispy, flaky, and baked up to a beautiful golden brown.

            So,the packaging was great,but that's only half the battle.To make a truly great empanda we need a 
            very flavorful filling, which I think we accomplished here,plus we want a lot of it.Either way,I really do
            hope you give these a try soon.
