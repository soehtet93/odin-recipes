        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>
            Cooking isn't about always doing the right thing, and this summer scramble is a perfect example.
            Adding juicy,sweet cherry tomatoes to a scramble tastes greats, but it's not a common practice since having a pool of liquid 
            under your eggs is considered bad form.
